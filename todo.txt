Remember how application works
    - what is the server doing
    - what is the frontend doing

make layout more responsive
    - below a certain screen width, turn the search type into a carousel
    - fix the album and band name fields being inverted
    - fix the dropdown menu's position given different window dimensions

fix handling on failed HTTP requests
    - UI doesn't reset when a request fails or experiences an error
