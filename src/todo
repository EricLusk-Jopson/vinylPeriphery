Can we even have environment variables in the frontend?
Are they secure?

If not, we construct a backend server which stores the env vars
upon searching, the frontend will use axios to query the server with the band and album names
the server will then perform the secure search that requires authentication
the server will then respond with the body of the discogs search response
the browser then performs the remainder of the API requests on the client side
